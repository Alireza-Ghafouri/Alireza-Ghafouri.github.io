This project focuses on **predicting saliency maps** (human visual attention) from images using deep learning models.

Main aspects of the project include:
- Implementing a model to map input images to continuous-valued saliency maps.
- Training and evaluation on saliency prediction datasets.
- Comparing qualitative saliency maps and quantitative performance across settings.
