In my role as a teaching assistant for the Machine Learning course (Spring 2022, 2023), I created interactive tutorials to introduce key concepts such as Linear & Nonlinear Regression, Regularization, Logistic Regression, Density Estimation (via Non-parametric methods), Kernel Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To aid student understanding, I complemented the material with instructional videos available as YouTube tutorials, providing comprehensive explanations in Persian.
